# üö¶ ALERT X

### **AI-Powered Traffic Management System for Smarter Urban Mobility**

---

## Project Overview

**ALERT X: Prism** is an advanced AI-driven traffic management system designed to enhance urban mobility by providing real-time traffic monitoring, violation detection, and dynamic signal optimization. Unlike traditional navigation tools, ALERT X leverages live camera feeds, computer vision, and AI analytics to offer precise and actionable insights into traffic conditions.

Key features include:

* **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Utilizes live CCTV feeds to monitor traffic flow and detect anomalies.
* **Violation Detection**: Employs computer vision models to identify traffic violations such as signal jumping and wrong-way driving.
* **Dynamic Signal Optimization**: Adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time data to alleviate congestion.
* **Incident Alerts**: Sends instant notifications to authorities and nearby vehicles in case of accidents or unusual traffic patterns.
* **Interactive Mapping**: Integrates **Leaflet.js** to render dynamic maps with overlays for traffic density, violations, and predictive congestion.

The system is built using **Samsung SmartThings** for IoT integration, **Samsung IoT Edge** for edge computing, and **Samsung Knox** for secure device connectivity, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for smart cities.
